# Final Iteration Use Cases

## Set Up & App Quirks
- Use URL: [https://auctionhouse24.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/login-page.html](https://auctionhouse24.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/login-page.html)
- Register both a **seller** and **buyer** account
- Admin is already registered
- When registered, login on 3 seperate tabs (one for seller, buyer, and admin) where admin username="admin" and password="password"
- If unable to access seller page use URL: [https://auctionhouse24.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seller-page.html?username=USERNAME] where **USERNAME** is your account username
- If unable to access buyer page use URL:  [https://auctionhouse24.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buyer-page.html?username=USERNAME] where **USERNAME** is your account username
- If unable to access admin page use URL: [http://auctionhouse24.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/admin-page.html]
- Sometimes on the buyer/seller pages, it's necessary to click **view, sorting, or search** buttons multiple times. The functions still work as intended.
