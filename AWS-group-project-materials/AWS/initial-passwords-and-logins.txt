I've created the AWS Group "aws24" with the following accounts you guys can login from and change your passwords:

USERNAME: jachlebowski PASSWORD: Jachlebowski1! SINGLE-SIGN-IN: https://816069151268.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
USERNAME: msgiorgio    PASSWORD: Msgiorgio1!	SINGLE-SIGN-IN: https://816069151268.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
USERNAME: seveilleux   PASSWORD: Seveilleux1!	SINGLE-SIGN-IN: https://816069151268.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
USERNAME: zihumphrey   PASSWORD: Zihumphrey1!	SINGLE-SIGN-IN: https://816069151268.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

Once you've logged in, he shows further instructions in his video to get you caught up with what you need to do. I'll start on the sql database tomorrow or Wednesday via AWS-handout-#2.pptx
